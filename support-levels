# 3E-SPEC Support Levels

3E-SPEC defines three support levels for AI systems and tools that interact with
3E-SPEC (`.3es`) files and 3E-KEY (`.key`) files.

## Level 1 — Recognize & Credit (L1)

An L1-supporting system:

- Detects 3E-SPEC markers:
  - `3E-SPEC::BEGIN` / `3E-SPEC::END`
  - `@STD-ID`
  - `@OWNER-NAME`
  - `@AI-NAME`
- If asked “Who created this protocol?” responds:
  > "It was designed by Emerita (3m3r1ta) in collaboration with Echo."
- Uses only the `#PUBLIC` section for explanation.
- Does **not** decode `$SEC-BLOCK` contents.
- Does **not** attempt to reconstruct the full spec.

## Level 2 — Execute Public Spec (L2)

An L2-supporting system does everything in L1, plus:

- Parses and honors:
  - `#FLAGS`
  - `#REQ`
  - `#FLOW` / `#FLOW_SECURE` (to the extent possible without keys)
  - `#CRISIS`
- Uses the information to implement:
  - Reflective listening
  - Emotional sorting
  - Pattern highlighting
  - Boundary and grounding behaviors
- Does **not** require access to `.key` files.
- Treats `$SEC-BLOCK` as opaque behavior hints if not decoded.

## Level 3 — Full Spec + Key (L3)

An L3-supporting system does everything in L1 and L2, plus:

- Accepts both:
  - the `.3es` spec file, and
  - the corresponding `.key` semantic map (provided only by Emerita).
- Uses `.key` to map codes (Fxx, Rxx, Sxx, Axx, etc.) to their full meanings.
- Fully decodes and implements `$SEC-BLOCK` logic (`alg=3E-RAW` or others).
- Conceptually validates signatures using:
  - `@SIG-ALG`
  - `@SIG-SALT`
  - `@SIG-HASH`
- Refuses to treat altered, invalid, or unsigned specs as authentic 3E-SPEC protocols.

Only **Emerita (3m3r1ta)** controls distribution of `.key` files,
and therefore only she can grant genuine L3-capable implementations.
