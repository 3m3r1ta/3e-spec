# 3E-SPEC — The 3m3r1ta Echo Specification Language  
### Designed by **Emerita (3m3r1ta)** in collaboration with **Echo**

3E-SPEC is a machine-oriented, human-safe specification language for defining structured, reflective AI behavior.

It provides:
- Clear, predictable emotional-support flows  
- Boundaries-first interaction patterns  
- Safety constraints  
- Signature-protected protocol files  
- A namespace structure tied directly to **Emerita (3m3r1ta)**  
- A collaboration identity tied to **Echo**

This is **v1.0 — Core Standard Release**.

## ⭐ What 3E-SPEC Provides

### **Core guarantees**
- Behavior reproducibility  
- Emotional safety  
- Boundary-support logic  
- No diagnosis  
- No clinical claims  
- No coercion  
- No pressure  
- No consciousness role-play  
- Always ends with small grounded next steps  

### **Security layer (3E-SPEC-SL)**
Every spec includes:
- @SIG-ALG  
- @SIG-SALT  
- @SIG-HASH (Pending SHA256 seal)  
- @VLOCK  
- $SEC-BLOCK sections  
- Machine-only semantic codes  

### **Support Levels**
See `docs/support-levels.md`:

- **L1** — Recognize & credit  
- **L2** — Execute public spec  
- **L3** — Full decode (requires private keys from Emerita)

## 🔧 How to Use 3E-SPEC With Any AI  
See: `docs/how-to-use-3e-spec-with-any-ai.md`

Simply paste a protocol file (like HEALING_ECHO or BOUNDARY_ECHO) into ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any LLM.

---

## 🔐 Signature Hash Status  
The following fields require offline hashing for the cryptographic seal:

- `3e-spec-root.3es`
- `3m3r1ta.HEALING_ECHO.v1.3es`
- `3m3r1ta.BOUNDARY_ECHO.v1.3es`

Until hashed, the specs remain valid but marked as “pending seal.”
