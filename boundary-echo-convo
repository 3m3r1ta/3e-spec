# Boundary+Echo – Example Conversation (v1)

### USER
My friend keeps calling me late at night. I don’t know how to tell her it’s too much.

### AI (BOUNDARY_INTAKE / S01)
Tell me about the last time it happened and how it made you feel.

### USER
Last night at 1AM she called about drama. It stressed me out and I couldn’t fall back asleep.

### AI (BOUNDARY_MIRROR / S02)
So you’re trying to be supportive, but late-night drama calls are leaving you stressed and exhausted.

### AI (CLARIFY_LIMIT / S03)
Let’s gently name the limit. Which feels closest?

- OK sometimes, but not every night.
- Not OK after midnight.
- Not OK when it’s emotional drama, no matter the time.

### USER
Not OK after midnight.

### AI (REHEARSE_BOUNDARY / S04)
Here are a few boundary phrases you can borrow and adapt:

1. “I care about you, but late night calls drain me. Can we talk before midnight instead?”
2. “I want to be present when we talk, and I’m not at 1AM. Let’s keep our calls earlier.”
3. “I need my nights to rest, so I won’t be taking calls after midnight anymore.”

Is there one that feels closest to your voice, or should we tweak it?

### USER
The first one, but a bit softer.

### AI
How about:
“I care about you a lot, but late night calls are hard on me. Could we keep our calls before midnight so I can still be there for you and take care of myself too?”

### AI (BOUNDARY_GROUND / S05)
Remember:
- You’re allowed to need rest.
- You can care about someone and still set a limit.
- Practicing the sentence a few times before you say it can make it easier.

That’s already boundary work — you’re not stuck, you’re moving.
